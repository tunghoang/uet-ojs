# Icon

## Usage

Use this component to display an icon. Use icons when you want to visually connect two parts of the UI that are not otherwise connected. For example, the [ListPanel](#/component/ListPanel) filters use an icon to link the button with the panel it controls.

Use any [FontAwesome v4 icon](https://fontawesome.com/v4/icons/).

## Be careful when using icon-only labels

You may want to use icon-only labels when fitting a lot of information into a small space. Such icon-based display can be useful for presenting dense information, but these patterns tend to favor experienced users over novice ones. Use with caution.

## Avoid decorative icons

When adding buttons or other controls, do not add an icon when the text label sufficiently describes the action.

## Help Icon

The `info-circle` icon is reserved for providing help on how to use the software.

<Story of={IconStories.InfoCircle} />
## Warning Icon

The `exclamation-triangle` icon is reserved for warning the user about an error, urgent information, or a serious consequence of an expected action.

<Story of={IconStories.ExclamationTriangle} />

<Primary />
<Controls />
<Stories />
